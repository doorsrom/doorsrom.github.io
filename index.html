<p class="introduction">
	Welcome to Doors - a Windows-like experience for your Android device!
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
	Doors comes with all the features you know from your Windows 10 Mobile phone. In addition to that, all the pre-installed apps of our Rom look totally like on Windows. Obviously, you also get the option to choose between a dark and a light mode plus an accent color, which gets applied across all system apps and other third party apps that support our theming engine.
</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
	Running Android, we provide you the best possible performance in Doors. Loading times are at a minimum and the whole OS runs fast and without any problems, regardless of you using a low end or high end device.
</p>
<h2>Customizability</h2>
<p>
	In later releases, we are also planning to add an extra customization page under settings allowing you to personalize the status bar, action center, recents as well as the rest of the UI.
</p>
<h2>Update support</h2>
<p>
	Doors promises you a fast and reliable update policy. We try to roll out all the updates as fast as it is possible to us. Despite that, we have three different types of updates.
</p>
<p>
	First up, Doors feature updates. As soon as a new Windows feature release is out, we will work hard on providing you all the new features of it. Yes, we will not stop the support at 1709 like Windows but will add more and more features as they come out on Desktop.
</p>
<p>
	Secondly, in our opinion, security is important. This means, we will release a new security patch in the first week of every month, as soon as Google has released a new security patch level. We will not keep Doors unprotected.
</p>
<p>
	Last but not least, since this is still an Android Rom, we will also keep the Android version up to date. Although we will not add the new designs of Android versions, we will try to provide all new features and under-the-hood changes so apps will work properly and you can enjoy the latest Android features while still using a Windows-like UI.
